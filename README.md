# R-Shiny-Project

## Overview
This project is a research tool involving a minimum viable strategy game which collects feedback on why learners make decisions in order to study transfer of learning.

The game involves scenarios where learners must make decisions to be successful. They are managing a business and are required to select features and sample sizes to test the features using hypothesis tests. The aim is to grow the subscriber base through good decisions. Learners don't do any analysis or testing themselves but will be given results from their choices. The game will automatically analyse all their desicions.

The aim of this game and project is to see whether learners are successful at using appropriate testing to grow the business. This will then collect feedback on why they made these decisions for the features, giving a strong starting point for studying transfer of learning.

### Development
This project follows an agile sprint style development approach. Weekly planning meetings give priorities and tasks for each component of the strategy game.
