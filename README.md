# R-Shiny-Project

## Overview
This project is a research tool involving a minimum viable strategy game which collects feedback on why learners make decisions in order to study transfer of learning.

The game involves scenarios where learners must make decisions to be successful. They are managing a business and are required to select features to enhance the business. The aim is to grow the subscriber base through good decisions. Learners will be given results from their choices. 

The game will require them to run A/B testing to see if the feature is effective. The learner will select their sample size and duration of the test and then the game with compute the results. After seeing these results the learner will decide whether to introduce the feature.

The aim of this project is to see whether learners are successful at using appropriate testing to grow the business. There are questions throughout asking why they made decisions and their thought process. This will then collect feedback for research, giving a strong starting point for studying transfer of learning.
