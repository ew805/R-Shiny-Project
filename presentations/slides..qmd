## Transfer of learning: terminology

1.  **Positive Transfer** understanding statistical concepts helps in understanding and applying hypothesis tests

    <!--(like t-tests, chi-square tests, etc.).

       * Example: A student who understands variability and sampling distributions is better equipped to grasp the logic of p-values and confidence intervals. -->

2.  **Negative Transfer** When prior knowledge leads to misconceptions or errors.

<!--   * Example: Misapplying the logic of deterministic math to probabilistic inference (e.g., thinking a p-value of 0.04 means there's a 96% chance the null hypothesis is false).-->

3.  **Near Transfer** Applying knowledge from similar contexts.

    <!-- * Example: Applying knowledge from a one-sample t-test to understand a two-sample t-test.-->

4.  **Far Transfer** Applying statistical inference skills to unfamiliar domains.

<!--   * Example: Using knowledge from a psychology experiment to interpret statistical results in a medical or economic study.-->

## Cognitive Factors Influencing Transfer

-   **Understanding vs. Memorization**: Students who *understand* the logic of hypothesis testing (e.g., the role of the null, Type I/II errors) are more likely to transfer that knowledge successfully.
-   **Metacognition**: Learners who reflect on their reasoning process can detect inappropriate transfer or generalize appropriately.
-   **Schemas and Mental Models**: Conceptual frameworks (like the logic of “evidence against a null”) help apply the method across various tests (t-test, ANOVA, etc.).

<!-- **Emphasize Conceptual Foundations**: Teaching effect size, variability, and sampling distributions helps with far transfer.
[//]: # **Use Multiple Contexts**: Teach hypothesis testing across domains (biology, economics, social science) to encourage transfer.
[//]: # **Address Misconceptions Directly**: Like the “p-value fallacy” or confusing statistical significance with practical significance.
[//]: # **Scaffold Transfer**: Use gradually more complex scenarios to help learners see the general structure behind specific tests. -->

## Example of Transfer in Practice

A psychology student who learns to conduct a t-test in a lab class might later:

-   Correctly apply the same test in a thesis experiment (positive near transfer).
-   Incorrectly assume that a small p-value always means a large effect size (negative transfer).
-   Correctly explain the limitations of p-values in public policy reports (positive far transfer).

## Examining transfer of learning

-   We are developing a simulation App which can (eventually) offer a variety of scenarios where user has to make decisions based on data
-   So we can ask why the user made those decisions

## We are familiar with questions like

1.  What was the null and alternative hypothesis in this test?

2.  What was the p-value, and what does it tell you about the null hypothesis?

3.  What decision was made based on the test? Was it to reject or not reject the null?

<!-- 4.  What assumptions are required for this test to be valid?

5.  What kind of test was used, and why was it appropriate for this context?

6.  What is a Type I vs. Type II error in this context? -->

## We want to ask about metacognitive processes and mental models

1.  Why are we doing quantitative research?

<!-- 1. What part of this test or decision-making process was most confusing or uncertain for you?

2.  If you had to teach this concept to a peer, what would you emphasize as most important? -->

2.  Did you consider any alternative explanations for the result before drawing your conclusion?

<!-- 4.  Do you think statistical significance always means the result is important? Why or why not? -->

3.  How would your interpretation change if the p-value had been just above .05?

<!-- 6.  What strategies did you use to decide whether the test result was trustworthy? -->

<!-- ## Mental model questions -->

<!-- 1.  Can you describe, in your own words, what a hypothesis test is doing? -->

4.  Why do we use a null hypothesis instead of just trying to prove what we believe?

<!-- 2.  If someone misinterpreted a p-value as the probability the null is true, how would you correct them? -->

<!-- 4.  What’s happening behind the scenes when a p-value is calculated?

5.  How is this test similar to or different from one you’ve seen before?

6.  If we repeated this test many times, what would you expect to happen in the long run? -->
